## How the Internet Works ?

### Internet 
  1. Interconnected network.  </br>
  2. The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other to share information, resources, and services.</br>
  3. **Connection** :- 1) Wired  2) Wireless

### History
  <ul>
    <li>The internet began in the 1960s as ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense project to create a communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack.</li>
    <li>They made this network to send data from source machine to destination machine in small chunks(i.e. packets) </li>
    <li>In 1969, the first message was sent between two computers, marking the birth of networked communication.</li>
    <li>The 1970s saw the development of TCP/IP, the foundational protocols for data transmission, and the first email was sent in 1971.</li>
    <li>1980s, the internet expanded beyond military and academic use, with the introduction of the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1984, making it easier to navigate.</li>
    <li>The 1990s brought the World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee, and the first web browser, Mosaic, which made the internet accessible to the public.</li>
    <li>The 2000s introduced social media Facebook, Twitter (X) and mobile internet with the iPhone, while the 2010s saw the growth of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT).</li>
    <li> The internet continues to evolve with Web3, AI, and quantum computing, shaping the future of global connectivity and innovation.</li>
  </ul>

  Note :- In the year 1998 Google was founded, revolutionizing how people search for information online.

### Client-Server Architecture
  <img src="https://madooei.github.io/cs421_sp20_homepage/assets/client-server-1.png">
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Client</b>:- Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers). </li>
    <li><b>Server</b>:- Server is a remote computer that provides information (data) or access to particular services.</li>
    <li><b>Request</b> :- ( get , put , post , delete ,etc)</li>
  </ul>

### ISP(Internet Service Provider)
  <ul>
    <li>An organization that provides internet access to individuals, businesses and other organizations. They connect us to the internet, either through wired connections (like fiber or cable) or wireless methods (like Wi-Fi or mobile data).</li>
    <LI>
      The first Internet Service Provider was Telenet. Telenet was the commercialized version of the ARPANET â€“ a precursor to the internet, of sorts. Telenet was introduced in 1974.
    </LI>
    <li>The ISP helps connect users to the internet via DSL, fiber optic, cable, or wireless connections.</li>
  </ul>

### Address
  <ul>
    <li>Communication is only possible if we know the address(IP Address) of the destination machine.</li>
    <li>So If the client wants to interact with the server so it must have the IP Address of the Server.</li>
  </ul>

### Protocol
